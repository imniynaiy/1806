    "# Gaussian elimination\n",
    "\n",
    "This Julia notebook allows us to interactively visualize the process of Gaussian elimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the process of [Gaussian elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination) involves subtracting rows to turn a matrix $A$ into an [upper triangular matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_matrix) $U$.  Often we *augment* the matrix with an additional column, representing the right-hand side $b$ of a system of equations $Ax=b$ that we want to solve: by doing the same row operations to both $A$ and $b$, we arrive at an equivalent equation $Ux=c$ that is easy to solve by *backsubstitution* (solving for one variable at a time, working from the last row to the top row).\n",

    "The basic Gaussian-elimination process is essentially the same as what you learned in 8th–9th grade algebra.   Where do we go from here?   There are several directions we would like to pursue in 18.06:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Zooming out and understanding this process *algebraically*: we want to think of elimination steps in terms of matrix operations (matrix products), and this will eventually lead us to viewing elimination as a *factorization* of the matrix A: the **LU factorization**.   This factorization is key to how Gaussian elimination is *actually used* in large problems, and it helps us *understand* A by breaking it into simpler matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What happens if you encounter a zero pivot?\n",
    "  - At the simplest hand-calculation level, you just swap rows *if you can*, as reviewed below.   But in practical numerical calculations something more interesting happens — it turns out that you need to swap rows even if the pivots are nonzero!  This eventually leads us to a \"PA = LU\" factorization, which is critical if you actually want to *use* Gaussian elimination in real life.\n",
    "  - If you *can't* swap rows to get rid of a zero pivot, then the matrix is *singular*.  In high school, you typically just give up if the matrix is singular, but it turns out that there are lots of things to say about this case.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* How does this process scale?   It is good to understand what happens for $n \\times n$ matrices.  Is Gaussian elimination practical on a computer for $n = 1000$?  What about $n = 10^6$?"
